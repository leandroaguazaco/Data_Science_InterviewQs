My practicing to get better at **data science interviews** by solving a few questions per week brought by [**InterviewQS**](https://www.interviewqs.com/), thank so much to them. I will use programming languages as `Python`, `R`, `SQL` and IDEs as `RStudio` and `Pgadmin4` to answer the questions. 

Every solved question  will present in `R Markdown` documents with RStudio and publish them via `GitHub`, using `GitHub Pages`
